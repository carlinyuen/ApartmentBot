This Bot demonstrates how to implement simple multi-turns using waterfalls. By
multi-turn we mean supporting scenarios where a user asks a question about 
something and then wants to ask a series of follow-up questions. To support this
the bot needs to track the current context or topic of the conversation. This
sample shows a simple way to use session.dialogState to do just that.

In this specific sample we're using a LuisDialog to to give the bot a more natural
language interface but there's nothing specific about multi-turn that requires the
use of LUIS.

The basic idea is that before we can answer a question we need to know the company 
to answer the question for. This is the “context” of the question. We’re using a 
LUIS model to identify the question the user would like asked and so for every 
intent handler we have the same two basic steps which we’re representing using a 
waterfall. 

The first step of our waterfall is a function called askCompany(). This function 
determines the current company in one of 3 ways. First it looks to see if the 
company was passed to us from an LUIS as an entity. This would be the case for a 
query like “when did microsoft ipo?”. If there was no company passed from LUIS 
then we check to see if we just answered a question about a company, if so we’ll 
use that as the current context. Finally, if the company wasn’t passed in and 
there is a current context then we’ll ask the user the name of the company to use.

In any case the output of askCompany() is passed to the second step of the 
waterfall which is a function called answerQuestion(). This function checks to see 
if the company was passed in (the only way it wouldn’t be is if the user said 
‘nevermind’ when asked for the company) and then sets that company to be the 
context for future questions and returns an answer for data that was asked for. 

# INSTALL THE MODEL

    The sample is coded to use a version of the LUIS models deployed to our 
    LUIS account. This model is rate limited and intended for sample use only so
    if you would like to deploy your own copy of the model we've included it in 
    the models folder. 
    
    Import the model as an Appliction into your LUIS account (http://luis.ai) and 
    assign the models service url to an environment variable called model.
    
         set model="MODEL_URL"

# RUN THE BOT:

    Run the bot from the command line using "node app.js" and then try saying the 
    following.

    Say: who founded google?
    
    Say: where are they located?
    
    Say: how can I contact microsoft?
    
    Say: when did they ipo?
